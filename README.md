matelight public control
========================

This is a simple web interface to control the [matelight](https://wiki.temporaerhaus.de/matelight) installation at the [temporaerhaus](https://temporaerhaus.de/) through the outside window.

It requires the WLED host and the PORT it should run on. You can provide them as environment variables `WLED_HOST` and `PORT` or as command line arguments `--wled-host` and `--port`.
